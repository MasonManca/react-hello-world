The Coddling of the American Mind

Intro:

Faux idioms presented by fake oracle (page 12-13):
    1. “What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker."
    2. "Always trust your feelings. Never question them.”
    3. "Life is a battle between good people and evil people.”

While many propositions are untrue, in order to be classified as a Great Untruth, an idea must meet three criteria:

1. It contradicts ancient wisdom (ideas found widely in the wisdom literatures of many cultures). 
2. It contradicts modern psychological research on well-being. 
3. It harms the individuals and communities who embrace it.
(Page 14).
