    There are quite a lot of truths behind CBT and antifragility as a whole. For CBT to be a commonly
used practice amongst PTSD patients, there must be some validity behind it. On that same coin,
when we observe the hygeine hypothesis, we can deduce that some things need to be exposed to 
stressors in order to grow stronger. For example, muscles, children, and bones all need to be broken down 
in order to build themselves back up stronger than they were before. This is a direct definition
of antifragility. Though we find ourselves in a time when scientific information is ever-changing.
Some things remain and hold true after countless years and scientific studies being conducted. I do think
we have steered course from taking adversity in stride. Far more often do I hear that I shouldn't do things 
which do not appeal to me. It has become a constant struggle to force myself to do challenging things
even though I know it will better me on the other side. Though, it is a slow and steady course; I am finding
that smooth seas never made a strong sailor.
